# 🌿Verdant

A collaboration platform where users can communicate and share stuff with each other. It serves as a small hub especially for developers to invite others and share their work. The app is mainly built for learning purposes as it has all the basic functions like CRUD and authentication. 

🔨 Main Technologies
- **`Nextjs:`** A powerful framework that makes routing, SEO, organizing and much more stuff easier for me
  
- `Typescript:` It’s hard to migrate from JavaScript at first, but it greatly improves the developer experience by helping catch type errors and making code more maintainable
  
- `Tailwind:` A utility-first CSS framework that makes styling fast, consistent, and highly customizable. I love how it speeds up making impressive designs
  
- `Shadcn UI:` A library of ready-to-use components that look great and are easy to customize, saving me time while keeping the UI polished and accessible
  
- `Supabase:` It's very convenient by solving authentication, image uploading, storing data and realtime function for me at the same time

```bash
npm run dev
